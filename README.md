# open_csb_door

This project aimes to automate the process of opening the door to my
previous apartment building when a friend comes to visit. The apartment
building lacks an intercom, but instead, you can log in on a website to
open the door.

This project automates this process. The app user can
either open the door with a click of a button or share a link with a friend.
The link contains a time- and usage-limited key which allows the friend to
open the door simply by clicking on a button.
